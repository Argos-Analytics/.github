# ARGOS Analytics

üß† precision software for digital pathology and laboratory automation  
we build robust, AI-powered tools for image analysis, data handling, and scientific workflows‚Äîdesigned for real labs, not just demos.

---

## üî¨ our mission

our goal is to enable faster, smarter, and more reproducible research by automating and optimizing lab processes.

we focus on:

- reducing manual work in microscopy and pathology  
- improving data accuracy, traceability, and reproducibility  
- enabling scalable, secure deployments in both **cloud** and **on-premise** environments

## üß™ what we‚Äôre developing

### üß† AI-POWERED IMAGE ANALYSIS  
- end-to-end pipelines using **YOLOv11**, **OpenCV**, and deep learning frameworks  
- support for **multi-class detection**, **quantification**, and **region-based analysis**  
- preprocessing pipelines: tiling, scaling, normalization, and augmentation  
- tools for training, evaluation, and continuous model improvement

### üß∞ CUSTOM TOOLING FOR RESEARCH  
- enhanced **CVAT** workflows for biological annotation  
- internal tools for slide parsing, focal plane extraction, and preview generation  
- CLI and UI interfaces tailored for high-resolution microscopy workflows

### üóÉ DATA & METADATA MANAGEMENT  
- modular **LIMS-like systems** for managing samples, annotations, and experiment metadata  
- versioning, validation, and standardized schemas using **JSON Schema**, **OpenAPI**, and **Bio-Formats**

### üîÑ DATA INGESTION & PIPELINING  
- automated pipelines for **upload**, **validation**, **annotation**, and **dataset generation**  
- support for large image formats (e.g., BigTIFF, AVS, VSI, SVS)  
- batch processing with parallel execution and structured logs

## üß† AI & ML TOOLING

we work across the entire AI lifecycle, including:

- **object detection**: YOLOv11, YOLOv8, Detectron2  
- **segmentation & classification**: U-Net, Mask R-CNN, Cellpose  
- **frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, ONNX  
- **preprocessing & augmentation**: Albumentations, Pillow, imgaug  
- **annotation & labeling**: CVAT, Label Studio, internal scripts  
- **training workflows**: Weights & Biases, MLflow, TensorBoard  
- **evaluation & analysis**: scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas  
- **deployment**: TorchScript, ONNX Runtime, FastAPI inference endpoints  
- **dataset management**: custom indexers, COCO format, Pascal VOC, TFRecord

---

## üèó how we deploy

we support flexible, secure deployment models depending on lab constraints:

- **cloud-native** with Docker, Terraform, AWS/GCP/Azure  
- **on-premise** installation packages with isolated networks and no internet dependency  
- support for **containerized environments**, **air-gapped systems**, and **custom storage backends**

---

## üîê security & compliance

built with lab environments in mind:

- minimal external dependencies  
- strict control over data ingress/egress  
- optional **RBAC**, **audit logging**, and **access policies**  
- isolated pipelines for sensitive workloads  
- compatible with **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, and **data protection policies** in regulated environments

## üåç how we work

ARGOS is a collaboration between software engineers, data scientists, and biologists.  
our approach is agile but grounded in lab realities‚Äîevery tool we ship solves a problem we‚Äôve seen firsthand.

- feedback loops with real lab users  
- reproducible workflows from dev to research  
- extensible modules for custom research setups

---

## ü§ù collaboration & contact

we‚Äôre open to collaboration with research groups, startups, and clinical teams.  
whether it‚Äôs co-developing models, tailoring infrastructure, or supporting deployment‚Äîwe‚Äôd love to talk.
